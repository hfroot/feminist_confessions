# feminist confessions

Inspired by ["The Guilty Feminist"](https://guiltyfeminist.com/),
 this app provides an anonymous platform to cleanse yourself of your feminist sins and have a peek
 at the sins of others. It's meant to be a light-hearted break from smashing the patriarchy and the
 various systems that patriarchy exacerbates.
 
Personally, it is also an opportunity to teach myself how to develop with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
 which seemed like a too-good-to-be-true answer to some headaches I faced with iOS development previously.
 
Spurred on by the [Just F*ing Ship It challenge](https://womenmake.com/30-day-challenge-2020)
 of October. Should this program find it's way to an app store near you it will cost some pence,
 which will be promptly shipped off to [Choose Love](https://choose.love/pages/about-choose-love).
 Hopefully writing this sentence out to be committed in Git history for evermore will provide extra
 incentive to get this done.
